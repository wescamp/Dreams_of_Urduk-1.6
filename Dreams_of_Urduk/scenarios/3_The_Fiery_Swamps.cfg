#3. The Fiery Swamps (649 SF, September)
#The nomads whom Rasduk had seized lordship over had a traditional ceremony for the passing on of authority; the new matriarch, the reigning male (her mate or, if she had none, her brother), and a select few of their companions must go out into the Fiery Swamps, so called for the will-o-the-wisps that lit it up, for three days and three nights, and hunt the wild beasts that lived there. Soma and Rasduk were subjected to this test. When the three days were up, Rasduk, Soma, and their companions returned from the trial with the corpses of many fell monsters.
