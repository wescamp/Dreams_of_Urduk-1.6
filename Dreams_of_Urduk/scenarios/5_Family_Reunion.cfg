#5. Family Reunion (652 SF, July)
#Rasduk and Soma led the nomads for several years, wandering aimlessly and living off the land. Eventually Rasduk began wondering what, if anything, had happened to his old village; had Urduk's dreams come true? The nomads slowly made their way to where Rasduk remembered the village to be. There they found the ruins of houses and, sleeping in the middle of the stone matriarchal hall, a dragon. Satisfied, they turned to leave, but before they had gotten more than a few miles from the village they ran into another nomadic group. It was led by none other than Sord, Rasduk's uncle; they were the survivors of the dragon's attack. Sord and Rasduk immediately grew hostile, and a violence broke out; the sounds of battle roused the dragon, and a fierce three-way fight commenced. Rasduk emerged victorious, slaying the dragon and subduing the menn of the old village. When Sord was dead, Rasduk allowed some of the defeated, including his mother Alfa, to join with the victors, and slew the rest.
